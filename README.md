# GitHub to Confluence Publisher

This repository contains a script that allows you to publish Markdown files from GitHub to Confluence. The script automates the process of converting Markdown files to Confluence markup and uploading them to your Confluence space.

## Setup

### Create new domain in Confluence cloud
    Create new cloud domain here https://my.atlassian.com/product

### Create new Space, a Parent page and API Token
You should create a Space and copy it's name from the URL (in my case: "Documentat". The full url is https://test-publisher.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Documentat/)
Create a new page and copy it's id. (in my case: "262359". the full url is https://test-publisher.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Documentat/pages/262359/Documentation+from+the+github)

Create new API key here https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens

### Configure the publisher in publisher/config/config.yaml

Replace this values with your values
''' yaml

confluence_url: https://test-publisher.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/

confluence_space: Documentat 
counfluence_parent_page_id: 262359
confluence_search_pattern: (this page is autogenerated)
github_folder_with_md_files: ./data
github_folder_with_image_files: ./data_images

'''

I use "confluence_search_pattern:" to find autogenerated pages and delete it each run. I recommend to use some random value like "(this page is autogenerated FGWSDF)"


### Setup a pipeline (example is provided in the github workflows folder)

Create you secrets and setup your pipeline.
Confluence expect you e-mail as a login and a API Key as a password.


## How it works

Your confluence space is empty
